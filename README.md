================

MyBikeRoutes.com uses Google Maps API to create and share bike routes. The index.html JavaScript source includes best path search algorithms such as Dijkstra and A*, which run on the bike paths that have been drawn by the users. The site uses the following: Google Maps API, JavaScript, AJAX, PHP and MySQL database. 

The website was developed as an undergraduate design project (2007-2008) at University of Toronto by Yasir Shoaib, Nikhil Vasandani and Amit Sinha, under the supervisor of Dr. Ashvin Goel. Enhancements to the website which included bug-fixing and improving the response time of the search algorithms were made by Yasir Shoaib between 2009-2012.

Before using the project and running the search, the Google Maps API key string has to be changed in the index.html file.
